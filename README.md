# House Prices Prediction

This repository hosts the code for predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The project is based on the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" competition from Kaggle.

## Description

Start here if...

- You have some experience with R or Python and machine learning basics.
- You are a data science student who has completed an online course in machine learning and are looking to expand your skill set before trying a featured competition.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

## Competition Description

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

## Practice Skills

- Creative feature engineering
- Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting

## Acknowledgments

The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.
